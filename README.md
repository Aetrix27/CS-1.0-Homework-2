This program chats with a user by responding to various words or repeated words that the user
says. This implements different functions and while and for loops to produce the desired chat
bot. The bot may seem rude or say things unrelated to what you are typing. 

You can ask the bot to tell you a joke, or tell it how you are feeling. You cannot put periods 
after input.
